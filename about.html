      <h1>What is Atlas?</h1>
      <p>Atlas is a fuel research company with one goal in mind-- to create a healthier fuel alternative to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon emissions. We hope to make Algae fuel a new and reliable way to fuel transportation vehicles. To accomplish this, we dedicate our time to creating algae fuel that can be used by said transportation devices, and sell it to non-profit organizations. </p>

      <h1>Our research</h1>
      <p>The research we do here at Atlas focuses mainly on the amount of carbon emissions per year, affecting pollution rates around the world. Even over the last few years, there has been a 20% increase in those whose healths' are negatively affected by pollution. We believe that we can make a change with our algae fuel, and strive to create a cleaner environment. </p>

      <h1>Where does it go?</h1>
      <p>All of our fuel is sold to Clean Fuel Associates, wherein they redistribute the fuel. We believe this is the best plan for our fuel, as we can't make much fuel monthly due to the amount of workers we have. The Clean Fuel Associates company also holds a similiar goal to our companies goal, to create environmentally friendly emissions. </p>
